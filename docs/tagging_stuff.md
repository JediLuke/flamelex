My strategy is to tag things as _nouns_. FOr example, if you have a reminder,
the tag is `reminder` not `reminders`. Although it fits into the class one
might call reminders, the thing itself, singularly, is a reminder, so that's
what we tag it as. The thing (i.e. the set) you might call `reminders` would be all the
other things which have the tag `reminder`
