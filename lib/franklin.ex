  Franklin - a personal organization and productivity tool.

  Franklin is a combined TiddlyWIki/Emacs/Calendar/AI that will hopefully
  let me get my life on rails!

  The main idea is to make a REPL based environment, like emacs. Make it
  also work like TiddlyWiki. Everything should be searchable, linkable.
